				<p>I find myself trapped in the Atlanta airport on Christmas Eve. This is not only a problem because Atlanta's airport is basically what I imagine the inside of Donald Trump's head to be like (complete with jugglers), but also because I am a feckless moron and thought I would be able to do my Christmas shopping on the 23rd and 24th in Denver.</p>
				<p>Of course, this is now a totally laughable plan. So I must resort to the only thing I'm actually good at: the internet!</p>
				<p>All of my love and happy Christmas or whatever!</p>
				<p>Joe</p>
				<a href="#select-yoself"><button>Okay, Joe - whatever. Let's get started!</button></a>

				<h1>Identify yourself!</h1>
				<p>Okay, but really - who are you?</p>

				<p>So moving into your own place for the first time in a while is pretty daunting.</p>

				<p>And we got to go to IKEA to help with that! Furniture - furniture everywhere!</p>

				<p>Now, usually I would say that getting someone a gift card is totally cheating...</p>

				<p>But in this case, I'm going to break that rule.</p>

				<p><b>SO, s</b>I'm getting you an IKEA gift card. I hope you love it. Buy all of the accessories that I don't know you need!</p>

				<p>So, I hear you're a big fan of things that go boom?</p>
				<img src="photos/khaleesi.GIF" class="gif"/>
				<p>Or, maybe more like this?</p>
				<img src="photos/boom.GIF" class="gif"/>
				<p>ORRR, maybe more like <i>this...</i></p>
				<img src="photos/stark.GIF" class="gif"/>
				<p>Okay, so admittedly your present is less of a <i>thing</i> than an experience - know what I mean?</p>
				<img src="photos/whatmean.GIF" class="gif"/>
				<p><b>Anyway,</b> whatever - here's the itinerary:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Leave.</li>
					<li>Travel to the NRA range.*</li>
					<li>Shoot guns.</li>
					<li>Go to the Dubliner and eat dinner and drink good Irish whiskey.</li>
				</ol>
				<p style="font-size:75%">*If it doesn't cause me to burtst spontaneously into flames.</p>
				<p>I'm serious about this. I'm even going to buy the ammunition.</p>
				<img src="photos/guns.GIF" class="gif"/>
				<p>So, the only thing is you have to actually tell me when you're free.</p>

				<p>So I'm really digging lately that you're basically as into space as I am. Obviously space is awesome and everyone should be obsessed with going to space somehow.</p>
				<img src="photos/rocket.GIF" style="height:50%"/>
				<p>So yours is very space themed (if that weren't already obvious?).</p>
				<img src="photos/space.GIF" class="gif"/>
				<p>And, because it's Christmas, I've made a temporary peace with Elon Musk and SpaceX - <i>just for you.</i></p>
				<img src="photos/elon.GIF" class="gif"/>
				<p>Obviously it's in the mail, but what's coming is a set of all of the mission patches from SpaceX missions.</p>
				<img src="photos/patches.gif" loop=infinite style="margin:auto"/>
				<p>One day, I'm sure you'll have mission patches of your own. For now, I hope these will do...</p>

				<p>So you were a little bit tricky. I love that we both love vinyl so I wanted to get you something that would be a really <i>special</i> record to have.</p>
				<p>But also, we both really like this musical called <i>Hamilton</i>, you may've heard of it.</p>
				<img src="https://d12edgf4lwbh8j.cloudfront.net/photo/image/Jefferson.gif" class="gif"/>
				<p>Mostly, Hamilton got me like...</p>
				<img src="https://d12edgf4lwbh8j.cloudfront.net/photo/image/Aaron--Leslie-Odom.gif" class="gif"/>
				<p>Unfortunately, they don't make <i>Hamilton</i> on vinyl yet...</p>
				<img src="https://d12edgf4lwbh8j.cloudfront.net/photo/image/okieriete.gif" class="gif"/>
				<p>So I got you this hat! Happy Christmas!</p>
