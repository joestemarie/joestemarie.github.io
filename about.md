Hi! My name is Joe. I'm a twenty-something living and exploring in Washington, DC.

This blog is, honestly, mostly to process. I find that writing about my experiences and documenting them helps to work through the good, the bad, and the ugly of living and, on rare occasion, I'm even inspired to share that thinking.

Since I spend so much of my life otherwise talking about politics, I'm trying not to do that here - so hopefully I'll focus on music, technology, and all the other things that I'm inspired by / interested in / working on / confused by / whatever else happens to come up.

Thanks for reading.
