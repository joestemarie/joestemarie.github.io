I'm sitting in a car on the way back to DC and just sent in my annual review for work - my first, ever. (How wonderfully corporate of me to celebrate this!). It's a milestone that seems to cap off an entire _year_ of milestones. But how could I possibly put this year into words? How could anyone?

As I was walking on the beach in North Carolina after Thanksgiving dinner, I stopped to chat with eighty-something man. The conversations had all the hallmarks of a chance encounter with an elderly man. He would, in my moment of reflection, turn and with an aged voice, deliver the sage advice I needed most.

But, oh - how hilariously wrong I happened to be.

He asked me where I was from (_"Denver, but I live in DC now"_) and then asked if I worked in politics (_"not exactly, but I work at a company that does some politics"_). He immediately began to wax apocalyptic in a soliloquoy about how America has gone to the dogs and how Donald Trump was the only person who could solve our problems (I'm not kidding) - even if everyone else thought he was the "horse's ass." (Just so we're clear, I'll vote for an actual horse's ass to be President before I vote for the Donald.)

He asked me if I thought there was any hope - and, when I answered immediately, I surprised even myself.

"I think there's still a lot of hope. I'm more hopeful than ever about our future. You know, it's like Bill Clinton said: ['There is nothing wrong with America that can't be solved by what is right with America.'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_inauguration_of_Bill_Clinton#Clinton.27s_Inaugural_Address) Sure, there are lots of problems to solve - but, in our short history, we've faced much bigger problems and triumphed over them."

Wait, _what?_ This is me, Joe, talking, right? You're sure you're not on some kind of drugs or mind control? Hypnosis?

That's, honestly, a pretty shocking response after the year that we've had. (This man, by the way, was pretty surprised, too, and after a moment of staring confused at me, simply said "that is an intelligent remark.")

The consensus among basically everyone I'm aware of is that 2015 has been a rough year - and that's putting it mildly. It's been a hard year for my family and friends. It was the first time I've ever really confronted dying and had to feel a real sense of loss. As my family changes significantly, the year has challenged and strained my parents and siblings. It seems like every successive week this year, something bad has happened: somebody died, somebody was sick, somebody had been hurt or robbed.

And it's not just us; it feels like it's been a horrifyingly difficult year for the world, too. The 2015 calendar seems littered with all manner of tragedies, from terrorist attacks to mass shootings to refugee crises. And in response, our political system seems, at _best_, an absolute joke, and at worst, totally hopeless.

But, still, in the face of all of that, I told this man that I have more hope than ever. I do.

Even if 2015 has held _far_ more than its share of tragedy and strife, it has been an incredible teacher. Despite all of the hurting, I have seen the true resilience of humanity in my friends and family, in my elected officials and in strangers. All of the suffering has been - for better and for worse - the "engine of renewal" that Clinton talked about.

In the face of the tragedy, my friends showed me the grace [that my President sang about in South Carolina](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IN05jVNBs64). I was welcomed in and sheltered, prayers were offered, and we all grew closer together. My close friends became a chosen, tight-knit family that showed me the true meaning of compassion. For every murderous madman, there was another old friend taking care to support us.

In the face of so many personal struggles for so many, we gathered to celebrate birthdays (including my twenty-first) and anniversaries. 

In the face of a political system gone haywire, I started my dream job full-time, where I've learned (sometimes the hard way) how to be a real adult and go to work everyday and, on my best days, try to make a difference. I'm lucky to be surrounded everyday by the smartest people that I've ever encountered.

In the end, I am humbled by the strength of the human spirit that has been on display during these trying months. Every tragedy or hurt has unveiled a new facet of our resilience. The real beauty of humanity is that we turn ashes into artwork, that our greatest injuries can give rise to real compassion, that our moments of true vulnerability resonate with an unthinkable strength and authenticity.

So I stand by my trite, clich√©, Bill Clinton-quoting remark on the beach. 2015 has challenged me to my core, but it has also been a year of tremendous opportunity and growth.

All of it had been summed up months earlier when one of my best friends and I returned to DC from Connecticut, in solemn silence, while _Bon Iver_ played. As we entered the city, he said, with a seemingly supernatural wisdom: "Well, Joe, I guess now it's up to us to rebuild."
